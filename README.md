# Automatic Bengali Text to IPA Transcription

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of automatically transcribing Bengali text into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) format. Accurate transcription is crucial for linguistic studies, language processing applications, and improving language learning tools. This project utilizes natural language processing techniques to achieve efficient and accurate transcription of Bengali text.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: The notebook includes functions to preprocess Bengali text for accurate transcription.
- **IPA Transcription**: Utilizes a phonetic mapping algorithm to convert Bengali script to IPA.
- **Visualization**: Displays examples of input text and corresponding IPA transcriptions.
- **Interactive Interface**: The notebook allows users to input text and receive immediate transcription results.

## Installation
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bengali-text-to-ipa-transcription.git
   cd bengali-text-to-ipa-transcription
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset
The transcription model is trained on a dataset of Bengali text paired with its IPA transcriptions. The dataset can be found at [insert dataset source]. This project may include a sample dataset within the data directory.

Data Preparation
Instructions for preparing the dataset for training and testing can be found in the notebook under the "Data Preparation" section.

## Usage
To use the notebook for transcription, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook cells sequentially. In the input cell, enter the Bengali text you want to transcribe, and execute the cell to see the IPA output.

Example input and expected output:

Input: বাংলাদেশ
Output: [bɑŋlɑdeʃ]
## Results
The notebook includes examples that demonstrate the accuracy of the IPA transcriptions generated. The results section presents a few input text samples alongside their respective IPA transcriptions for comparison.
